## About Me

I am a senior web developer and development team lead. I've worked with a broad range of packages, languages, and personalities in some capacity or another. In my career, I have mentored a team of 7 developers, integrated Magento and Oracle, developed Android applications, customized Oracle EBS, optimized poorly-performing web applications, and much more!

I have an acute memory and attention to detail. I am an invested contributor to brainstorming sessions and team discussions. I provide as much value to conversations about SEO, page speed, checkout optimization, and UX as the value I provide to the codebase, code reviews, sprint planning, and discussions about development best practices.

I am active on [KnoxDevs Slack](http://www.knoxdevs.com/) and in numerous local industry meetups, including [KnoxPHP](http://www.meetup.com/KnoxPHP-User-Group/), which I cohost.

I love my fiancee, Kate, and my corgi, Chester. I appreciate old houses, electronic music, and good food with friends. I enjoy hiking, craft beer, and funny internet pictures.
