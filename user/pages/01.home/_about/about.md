## About Me

I am a senior e-commerce developer and development team lead. I've worked with a broad range of packages, languages, and personalities in some capacity or another. In my 15+ year career in e-commerce, I have mentored a team of 7 developers, integrated Magento 1 and Oracle EBS, supported migration of 9 figures of annual revenue from Magento 2 (Adobe Commerce) to Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud (Demandware / SFCC), optimized poorly-performing web applications, and much more!

I have an acute memory and attention to detail. I am an invested contributor to brainstorming sessions and team discussions. I provide as much value to conversations about SEO, page speed, checkout optimization, and UX as the value I provide directly to the codebase, code reviews, sprint planning, and discussions about development best practices. I am a quick study and thrive on challenges.

I love my wife Kate, travel, and web development. I appreciate old houses, electronic music, and good food with friends. I enjoy hiking, craft beer, and funny internet pictures.
