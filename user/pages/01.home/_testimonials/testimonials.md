    - author: John McCombs, Business Owner, Core Development, Inc
      content: Everett is hands down one of the most capable developers I've seen. [...] He is respectful of others' opinions, but isn't afraid to point out potential problems. [He] is helpful in bridging communication gaps between developers and non-developers. He is passionate about web development and it has given him a breadth and depth of understanding of the subject matter that is very uncommon. [...] I can't recommend him enough.
